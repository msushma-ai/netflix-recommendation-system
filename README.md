## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to build a realistic Netflix-style web application that not only replicates the visual design and user experience of Netflix but also serves as a foundation for implementing **machine learningâ€“based movie recommendation models**. The future goal is to integrate algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation systems to deliver personalized movie suggestions to users, creating a complete end-to-end data-driven entertainment platform.
